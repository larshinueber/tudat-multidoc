  - name: AccelerationSettings
    short_summary: "Functional base class to define settings for accelerations."
    extended_summary: |
      Class for providing settings for acceleration model. This class is a functional (base) class for
      settings of acceleration models that  require no information in addition to their type.
      Classes defining settings for acceleration models requiring additional information must be derived from this class.
      Bodies exerting and undergoing acceleration are set externally from this class.
      This class can be used for the easy setup of acceleration models
      (see createAccelerationModels.h), but users may also chose to do so manually.
      (Derived) Class members are all public, for ease of access and modification.

      The acceleration components are defined according to Montenbruck and Gill (2000), with a total of 9 components:
      a constant, sine and cosine term (with true anomaly as argument) for each of the three independent directions of
      the RSW frame.

    extended_summary: |
      Creates settings for the spherical harmonic gravity acceleration, accounting for a finite (given as input) number

      The body exerting the acceleration needs to have a spherical harmonic gravity field model (see :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.gravity_field.spherical_harmonic`) and a rotation model (:ref:`\`\`rotation_model\`\`` module) defined. 

      Depending on the body undergoing the acceleration :math:`A`, the body exerting the acceleration :math:`B`, and the central body of propagation :math:`C`, choosing this option may create a direct spherical harmonic attraction (:math:`\mu=\mu_{B}`), a central spherical harmonic attraction (:math:`\mu=\mu_{B}+\mu_{A}`) or a third-body spherical harmonic attraction (see `here <https://docs.tudat.space/en/latest/_src_user_guide/state_propagation/propagation_setup/translational/third_body_acceleration.html>`_ for more details).

  # Mutual spherical harmonic gravity
  - name: mutualSphericalHarmonicAcceleration # [cpp]
  - name: mutual_spherical_harmonic_gravity # [py]    
    short_summary: "Creates settings for the mutual spherical harmonic gravity acceleration."
    extended_summary: |
      Creates settings for the mutual spherical harmonic gravity acceleration. This model computes the total spherical harmonic acceleration exerted by a body :math:`B` on a body :math:`A`, where the influence of the gravity field coefficients of body :math:`A` itself has been included. The model includes couplings between the mass of each body, and the gravity field coefficients of the other body. It does not include the 'figure-figure' interactions (coupling between the two-bodies' gravity field coefficients). It corresponds to the model presented by Lainey et al. (2004); Dirkx et al. (2016).  
      The model combines the spherical harmonic accelerations of the two bodies (see :func:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.propagation_setup.acceleration.spherical_harmonic`) on each other. The direct acceleration (acceleration w.r.t. an inertial origin) is computed from:

      .. math::

         \mathbf{a}={-\frac{\mu_{_{B}}}{{r}^{2}}\hat{\mathbf{r}}}+{\mathbf{R}^{(I/B)}\nabla^{(B)}U_{\hat{B}}(\mathbf{r})}-{\frac{\mu_{_{B}}}{\mu_{_{A}}}\mathbf{R}^{(I/A)}\nabla^{(A)}U_{\hat{A}}(-\mathbf{r})}

      where :math:`U_{\hat{B}}` and :math:`U_{\hat{A}}` denote the spherical harmonic gravity fields a degree :math:`>=1` of bodies :math:`B` and :math:`A`, respectively.
      Both the body exerting the acceleration and the body undergoing it need to
      have spherical harmonic gravity field and rotation models defined.

      Depending on the body undergoing the acceleration :math:`A`, the body exerting the acceleration :math:`B`, and the central body of propagation :math:`C`, choosing this option may create a direct spherical harmonic attraction (as above), a central spherical harmonic attraction (:math:`\mu_{B}\rightarrow\mu_{B}+\mu_{A}`, in the above equation and in :math:`U_{\hat{B}}`) or a third-body spherical harmonic attraction (see `here <https://docs.tudat.space/en/latest/_src_user_guide/state_propagation/propagation_setup/translational/third_body_acceleration.html>`_ for more details).

      For the case where a third-body mutual spherical harmonic acceleration,
      additional parameters have to be provided that denote the expansion degree/order of the central body (``maximum_degree_central_body`` and ``maximum_order_central_body``)

    short_summary: "Creates settings for empirical acceleration."
    extended_summary: |
      Creates settings for empirical accelerations. These are expressed in the
      RSW frame, for which the magnitude is determined empirically (typically during an orbit determination process).
      The acceleration components are defined according to Montenbruck and Gill (2000), with a total of 9 components:
      a constant, sine and cosine term (with true anomaly as argument) for each of the three independent directions of
      the RSW frame. The empirical acceleration is calculated as:

       .. math::

          \mathbf{a}=R^{I/RSW}\left(\mathbf{a}_{\text{const.}}+\mathbf{a}_{\sin}\sin\theta+\mathbf{a}_{\cos}\cos\theta \right)

      Here, :math:`R^{I/RSW}` is the rotation matrix from the RSW frame (of the body undergoing the acceleration w.r.t. the
      body exerting the acceleration), :math:`theta` is the true anomaly, and the three constituent acceleration vectors are
      the inputs provided in the above code block. The body 'exerting' the acceleration is considered to be the
      central body, w.r.t. which the true anomaly is calculated.

      particular tidal dissipation, on a planetary satellite. The acceleration computed can account for either the

    extended_summary: |
      The acceleration model is purpose-built to represent short bursts of thrust, such as a momentum wheel desaturation.
      A typical use case is precise orbit determination, but the functionality can be used just as well in propagation
      (for instance to model an impulsive manuever in a continuous manner when going from preliminary modelling to
      full modelling). The thrust is modelled similarly to Fig. 3 of Alessi et al. (2012), with the main difference
      being that a third-order polynomial to go from zero acceleration to the maximum acceleration level is employed.
      By using a 3rd-order polynomial and imposing continuity in the value and first derivative of the acceleration,
      defining the rise time (time it takes acceleration to go from 0 to its maximum level), the total time where
      there is non-zero thrust (total maneuver time), and the total Delta V exerted by a single maneuver,
      the acceleration profile is fully defined.

  # Yarkovsky acceleration
  - name: yarkovskyAcceleration # [cpp]
  - name: yarkovsky # [py]
    short_summary: "Creates settings for the Yarkovsky acceleration."
    extended_summary: |
      Creates settings for the Yarkovsky acceleration, which is calculated based on Pérez-Hernández & Benet (2022). The acceleration is only
      considered in the tangential direction and is proportional to:

      .. math::

         \mathbf{a}=A_{2} \cdot (\frac{r_{0}}{r_{S}})^{2}

      where :math:`A_{2}` is the Yarkovsky parameter, :math:`r_{0} = 1` AU and :math:`r_{S}` is the heliocentric distance in AU.

    parameters:
      - name: yarkovsky_parameter # [py]
        type: float # [py]
        description: Value of the Yarkovsky parameter.

    returns:
        type: AccelerationSettings
