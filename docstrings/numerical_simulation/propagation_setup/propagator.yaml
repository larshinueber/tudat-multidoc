      Base class to define settings on how the numerical results are to be used, both during the propagation (printing to console) and after propagation (resetting environment)
      Instances of this class are typically not created by the user. Settings objects for derived class of single-, multi- and hybrid arc propagation are 
      instantiated through the factory functions to define propagator settings (such as :func:`~translational` or :func:`~multi_arc`) in this module
          
    methods:

    properties:
    - name: clear_numerical_solution # [py]
      type: bool
      description: |    # [py]
        Boolean defining whether the propagation results should be
        deleted after the propagation is terminated. If this is
        done, the :py:attr:`~state_history`,
        :py:attr:`~unprocessed_state_history` and
        :py:attr:`~dependent_variable_history` will not be
        available in the :py:class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.propagator.SingleArcSimulationResults` class. Putting this setting to True (deleting the
        results) is only sensible when the
        :py:attr:`~set_integrated_result` is set to True. In that
        case, the propagated states are *not* accessible directly
        from this objects, but the results are used to update the
        environment, *e.g.* update the ephemeris of the propagated
        body with the numerical results.

    - name: set_integrated_result # [py]
      type: bool
      description: |  # [py]
        Boolean defining whether the propagation results are to
        be used to update the environment. If this variable is set
        to False, the numerical propagation results can be
        retrieved from this object (provided the
        :py:attr:`~clear_numerical_solution` is set to False),
        but the (for instance) Ephemeris of the propagated body
        is not updated with the propagation results. If this
        variable is set to True, the properties of the propagated
        :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment.Body`
        object will be updated as per the numerical results
        (see `here <https://docs.tudat.space/en/latest/_src_user_guide/state_propagation/propagation_setup/printing_processing_results.html#automatic-processing>`_ for details).

  # Time termination
  - name: propagationTimeTerminationSettings # [cpp]
  - name: time_termination # [py]
    short_summary: "Factory function to create time termination settings for the propagation."
    extended_summary: |
      Factory function to create time termination settings for the propagation.
      The propagation is stopped when the final time provided is reached. Note that the termination time is set as the
      absolute time (in seconds since J2000), not the time since the start of the propagation.
      Depending on the sign of the time step of the numerical integrator, the termination time will be treated as an
      upper bound (for positive time step) or lower bound (for negative time step).
      The simulator will normally finish the final time-step, which may cause the termination time to be slightly exceeded.
      This behaviour can be suppressed by providing the optional input argument
      ``terminate_exactly_on_final_condition=True``, in which case the final propagation step will be *exactly* on the
      specified time.

    notes: |
      To reach *exactly* the final time, state derivative function evaluations beyond the final
      time may be required by the propagator. Reaching the final condition exactly is an iterative process and
      very minor deviations from the specified final condition can occur.

    examples: |
      In this example, we set the termination time of the propagation equal to one day (86400 $s$).

    extended_summary: |
      Factory function to create termination settings for the propagation based on the value of a dependent variable.
      The propagation is stopped when a provided upper or lower limit value is reached.
      The simulator will normally finish the final time-step, which may cause the dependent variable to be slightly exceeded.
      This behaviour can be suppressed by providing the optional input argument
      ``terminate_exactly_on_final_condition=True``, in which case the final propagation step will be *exactly* on the

    examples: |
      Below, an example is shown for termination on a given vehicle altitude. The exact termination condition is defined
      in the ``termination_settings``. The propagation is terminated once the *lower* limit of 25 km in altitude is
      reached (as the ``use_as_lower_limit`` is set to ``True``). To use the above settings to terminate when an
      *upper* limit of 25 km is reached, set this boolean to ``False``. In this example, we also want to stop exactly
      at 25 km, so we set ``terminate_exactly_on_final_condition`` to ``True``, and we specify ``termination_root_finder_settings``.

      Factory function to create non-sequential termination settings for the propagation. By using this setting,
      the propagation of the dynamics along an arc is propagated starting from some point (initial time and state) along the arc, and then
      propagating both forwards and backwards in time. This termination condition allows the user to specify 
      termination conditions for the propagations forwards and backwards in time. These two propagations are then
      internally performed separately, but the resulting propagation results provide the concatenated results
      from the two and effectively constitute
      By using this function, the propagation controlled by the ``forward_termination_settings`` automatically has a positive
      time step, while the ``backward_termination_settings`` automatically has a negative time step. By definition,
