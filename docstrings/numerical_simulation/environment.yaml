summary : "Functionalities of environment objects."

extended_summary: |
  This module provides functionalities for environment objects. Specifically, it contains
  classes and functions that perform computations related to environment models of natural and artificial bodies.
  Much of the functionality in this module concerns classes stored inside :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment.Body` objects, a list of which is in turn
  stored in a :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment.SystemOfBodies` object. Note that the classes in this module are rarely created manually, 
  but are instead created by the functionality in the :ref:`\`\`environment_setup\`\`` module. 


enums:

    extended_summary: |
      Enumeration of reference frame identifiers typical for aerodynamic calculations. Note that the frames are also defined
      in the absence of any aerodynamic forces and/or atmosphere. They define frames of a body w.r.t. a central body, with
      the details given by Mooij (1994). The chain of frames starts from the inertial frame, to the frame fixed to the
      central body (corotating), to the vertical frame (defined by the body's relative position), the trajectory and aerodynamic frames
      (defined by the body's relative velocity) and finally the body's own body-fixed frame.

          The rotation from inertial frame (with global frame
          orientation) to this Body's body-fixed frame. The rotation is
          always returned here as a rotation matrix.  If the body's
          rotational state is numerically propagated, this property gets
          extracted from the propagated state vector. If it is not
          propagated, the state is extracted from this body's rotational
          ephemeris.

          .. note:: This function is **only** valid during the
                    numerical propagation if any aspects of the dynamics
                    or dependent variables require the body's rotational
